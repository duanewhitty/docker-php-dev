# docker-php-dev
PHP environment setup for developing with Vim as an IDE all in Docker

Many thanks to Toon Daelman for his great article, "VIM As A PHP IDE - Setting Up"
https://engagor.github.io/blog/2017/01/01/vim-ide-setting-up/

Thanks to Chris Wiseman at GetChalk.com for sparking the idea that Docker could
be used for dev purposes instead of setting up a virtual machine.

Thanks to Tim Pope for so many great Vim plugins, especially Pathogen and Fugitive!
